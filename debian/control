Description: GNOME keyring services (daemon and tools)
 gnome-keyring is a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent,
 and other applications can use it to store passwords and other
 sensitive information.
 .
 The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
 password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
 disk, but forgotten when the session ends.

Description: PAM module to unlock the GNOME keyring upon login
 gnome-keyring is a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent,
 and other applications can use it to store passwords and other
 sensitive information.
 .
 This package contains a PAM module that will automatically unlock the
 keyrings using your login password, making gnome-keyring usage
 transparent without losing its security benefits.
 .
 When installed, this module will automatically be used by GDM and
 gnome-screensaver to unlock your keyrings when logging in and when
 unlocking the screen saver.
